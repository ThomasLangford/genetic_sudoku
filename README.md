Using genetic algorithms to solve a game of Sudoku.
The Sudoku puzzle is a combinatorial number placement problem where the player must fill a partially completed nine by nice grid with sets of the numbers one to nine. These numbers must be placed in a way such that each row, column, and three by three sub grid contains a unique set. Due to this constraint on the placement of numbers, Sudoku proves to be a NP-complete problem which makes it impracticable to solve using a direct method. Instead a heuristic search method must be applied to the problem, of which the genetic algorithm metaheuristic is implemented here.
